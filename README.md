# PDF to CSV

This is an in-class exercise at Columbia Universityâ€™s [Lede Program](https://ledeprogram.com/). The online app, which uses `React JS`, allows a user to upload a local `pdf` file and convert it into `csv` format.

Thanks to [Jonathan Soma](https://github.com/jsoma) for the instruction.
